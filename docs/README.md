# Airelian Tactics - Documentation

## Overview
Airelian Tactics is a turn-based tactics game, repurposed from OpenTactics/AurelianTactics codebase. This documentation provides comprehensive coverage of the project architecture, systems, and gameplay mechanics.

The game features a sophisticated state-driven architecture with AI opponents, configurable teams and maps, and a robust turn-based combat system powered by charge time (CT) mechanics.

## Quick Start Guide

### Building and Running
1. **Prerequisites**: .NET 9.0 SDK (may work on earlier versions)
2. **Clone Repository**: `git clone <repository-url>`
3. **Navigate to Project**: `cd airelian-tactics`
4. **Run Application**: `dotnet run --project AirelianTactics`

### Basic Game Flow
1. **Initialization**: Game loads configurations and sets up the battlefield
2. **Combat**: Turn-based tactical combat with human and AI players
3. **Victory**: Game ends when only one team remains standing

## Architecture Overview

### State-Driven Design
The game uses a state machine architecture with the following core states:
- **GameInitState**: Loads configurations and initializes game components
- **CombatState**: Manages turn-based combat loop
- **UnitActionState**: Handles human player input and actions
- **AIActionState**: Processes AI decision-making and actions
- **GameEndState**: Displays results and handles game conclusion

### Services Layer
Shared services provide consistent data access across all states:
- **UnitService**: Unit management and turn processing
- **Board**: Map and position management
- **GameTimeManager**: Turn order and action timing
- **AllianceManager**: Team relationships and targeting
- **SpellService/StatusService**: Future ability and status systems

### Configuration System
JSON-based configuration enables flexible game setup:
- **Game Config**: Victory conditions, team references, and alliance definitions
- **Team Configs**: Unit statistics, AI flags, and team properties
- **Map Configs**: Battlefield layout and tile properties

## Key Features

### AI Opponents
- **Intelligent Decision Making**: Priority-based AI with target selection and movement
- **Mixed Teams**: Human and AI teams can play together in various configurations
- **Alliance Support**: Complex team relationships including allies, enemies, and neutrals

### Turn-Based Combat
- **Charge Time System**: Speed-based turn order with strategic timing
- **Action Variety**: Move, Attack, and Wait actions with future expansion planned
- **Tactical Positioning**: Unit placement and movement affect combat outcomes

### Flexible Configuration
- **JSON Setup**: Easy modification of teams, maps, and game rules
- **Snake Draft**: Fair unit ID assignment prevents gameplay imbalances
- **Extensible Design**: Framework supports future features and enhancements

## Development Information
